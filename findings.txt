It seems that:

1.SCH_STATUS_MAGNET gets a higher propotion than the JJ.

2.In SCH_STATUS_MAGNET, the porpotion of male and female is similar.

3.In JJ,the porpotion of male is far higher than the female, which is just like my expectation.After all,boy are more likely to fight,play truant(or do something like that) during his youth.

4.The porpotion of different race in our data is similar to the Wikipedia's U.S. race demography page's data.But I guess the Wiki's White people include the White and Hispanic in our data.
